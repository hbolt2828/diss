# dissertation on the Bayesian inference for the severity and infectivity of Covid 19
This is the code for my study. The ARIMA code is used to forecast future deaths and cases of the virus and the number of 1st and second vaccinations.
The outbreak code is used to discuss the different peaks in the number of cases and deaths in the UK
The vaccination outbreak is used to discuss the third outbreak and how the number of vaccinations have softened the severity of the virus' impact
The Rvalue code shows how the R value in the England has changed over time, with ARIMA modelling being used to predict the future
